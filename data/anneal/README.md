The original Annealing dataset from UCI. The exact meaning of the features and classes is largely unknown. Annealing, in metallurgy and materials science, is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more workable. It involves heating a material to above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature, and then cooling. (Wikipedia)

    -- The '-' values are actually 'not_applicable' values rather than
       'missing_values' (and so can be treated as legal discrete
       values rather than as showing the absence of a discrete value).
