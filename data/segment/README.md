Image Segmentation Data Set
The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The images were hand-segmented to create a classification for every pixel. Each instance is a 3x3 region.
 
### Attribute Information  

1.  region-centroid-col:  the column of the center pixel of the region.
2.  region-centroid-row:  the row of the center pixel of the region.
3.  region-pixel-count:  the number of pixels in a region = 9.
4.  short-line-density-5:  the results of a line extractoin algorithm that 
          counts how many lines of length 5 (any orientation) with
          low contrast, less than or equal to 5, go through the region.
5.  short-line-density-2:  same as short-line-density-5 but counts lines
          of high contrast, greater than 5.
6.  vedge-mean:  measure the contrast of horizontally
          adjacent pixels in the region.  There are 6, the mean and 
          standard deviation are given.  This attribute is used as
         a vertical edge detector.
7.  vegde-sd:  (see 6)
8.  hedge-mean:  measures the contrast of vertically adjacent
           pixels. Used for horizontal line detection. 
9.  hedge-sd: (see 8).
10. intensity-mean:  the average over the region of (R + G + B)/3
11. rawred-mean: the average over the region of the R value.
12. rawblue-mean: the average over the region of the B value.
13. rawgreen-mean: the average over the region of the G value.
14. exred-mean: measure the excess red:  (2R - (G + B))
15. exblue-mean: measure the excess blue:  (2B - (G + R))
16. exgreen-mean: measure the excess green:  (2G - (R + B))
17. value-mean:  3-d nonlinear transformation
          of RGB. (Algorithm can be found in Foley and VanDam, Fundamentals
          of Interactive Computer Graphics)
18. saturatoin-mean:  (see 17)
19. hue-mean:  (see 17)
