The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To build an FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. \n\n### Attribute Information  \n* V1: Recency - months since last donation\n* V2: Frequency - total number of donation\n* V3: Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.\n* V4: Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).\n\nThe target attribute is a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (2 stands for donating blood; 1 stands for not donating blood).", "description": "The resources for this dataset can be found at https://www.openml.org/d/1464\n\nAuthor: Prof. I-Cheng ", "licenses": [{"name": "ODC-PDDL", "path": "http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/", "title": "Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License"}]}
