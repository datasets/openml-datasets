Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set  
Data taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan -- this is a classification problem.

To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model (a modified version of RFM), this study adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To build an FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. 

### Attribute Information  
* V1: Recency - months since last donation
* V2: Frequency - total number of donation
* V3: Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.
* V4: Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).

The target attribute is a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (2 stands for donating blood; 1 stands for not donating blood).
