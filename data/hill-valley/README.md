Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y coordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a “bump” in the terrain) or a Valley (a “dip” in the terrain). 
See the original source for some examples of these graphs. 

In the original form, there are six files. This is the non-noisy version, with training and test sets merged. 

### Attribute Information:

1-100: Labeled “X##”. Floating point values (numeric), the Y-values of the graphs.  
101: Labeled “class”. Binary {0, 1} representing {valley, hill}
