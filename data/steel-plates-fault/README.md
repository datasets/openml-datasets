Steel Plates Faults Data Set  
A dataset of steel plates' faults, classified into 7 different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition.

The dataset consists of 27 features describing each fault (location, size, ...) and 7 binary features indicating the type of fault (on of 7: Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other_Faults). The latter is commonly used as a binary classification target ('common' or 'other' fault.)
