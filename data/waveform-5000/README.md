Note: There is [an earlier version](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Waveform+Database+Generator+(Version+1)) of this dataset that only has 21 attributes (it does not add the 19 noise features).

### Attribute Information

40 attributes describing the waveform, all of which include noise. The latter 19 attributes are all noise attributes with mean 0 and variance 1.
