 4. Relevant Information:
    This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive
    Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not 
    pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The 
    problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice 
    (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based 
    on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
