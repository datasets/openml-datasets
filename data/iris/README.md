Iris Plants Database  
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is     linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.  
This is an exceedingly simple domain.
