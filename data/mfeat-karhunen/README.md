Multiple Features Dataset: Karhunen  
One of a set of 6 datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images. 

### Attribute Information  
The attributes represent 64 descriptors from the Karhunen-Loeve Transform, a linear transform that corresponds to the projection of the images on the eigenvectors of a covariant matrix. Also see:
