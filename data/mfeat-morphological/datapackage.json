Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images. \n\nIn this dataset, these digits are represented in terms of 6 morphological features. \n\n### Attribute Information  \nThe meaning of the features is mostly unknown. They are never named in the original files, and the paper only talks about 'morphological features, such as the number of endpoints'.\n\n### Relevant Papers  \nA slightly different version of the database is used in  \nM. van Breukelen, R.P.W. Duin, D.M.J. Tax, and J.E. den Hartog, Handwritten digit recognition by combined classifiers, Kybernetika, vol. 34, no. 4, 1998, 381-386.\n \nThe database as is is used in:  \nA.K. Jain, R.P.W.
