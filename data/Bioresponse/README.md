Predict a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this data set represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response (1), or not (0). The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors (d1 through d1776), these are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule - for example size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized.

The original training and test set were merged.
